## 👋 Hi, I’m George Enache

Infrastructure & Hybrid Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience in enterprise environments, 
working across on-prem datacenters, virtualization and cloud platforms.

This repository (and the enache.cloud website) documents **infrastructure and cloud projects**  
designed to reflect **real-world engineering thinking**, not tutorials or academic exercises.

## 🧠 What this is about

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate how I approach:

- Infrastructure design and operations
- Hybrid cloud environments (on-prem + Azure)
- Automation and standardization
- Security, reliability and maintainability
- Enterprise-style problem solving

All projects are built or simulated with **production mindset**:
clear scope, constraints, trade-offs and operational impact.
